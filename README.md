<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Phil 👨‍💻</h1>

<h3 align="center">Programming rookie and movie buff</h3>
<p></p>
<h3 align="left">About me:</h3>
<p>For several years I worked in german television as author and editor. But threw Unity (game dev) I found my way into programming with C#. At the moment I am looking into other languages like python and java.</p>
<p>I always loved to learn the use of new applications which I almost all learned self-taught. My first little games sparked my enthusiasm for programming and made me love solving problems, finding bugs and spending hours to find the needle in the haystack.😂</p>
<p>So I decided to make a hobby and passion into a job. For in germany certificates and diplomas are absurdly highly esteemed I - at my high age 😉 - started an apprenticeship in application development. I aim to be a good role model for my children and try to teach them that with curiosity, courage and creativity they can change their life to whatever they want.</p>
<h3 align="left">Simple facts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>🔭 I’m currently working on getting my IT Specialist(Application Development) / Fachinformatiker(Anwendungsentwicklung)</li>
